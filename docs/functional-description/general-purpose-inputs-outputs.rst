General purpose inputs/outputs(GPIOs)
=======================================

Each of the GPIO pins can be configured by software as output (with pull-up or pull-down), as input (with pull-up or pull-down) or as peripheral alternate function. Most of the GPIO pins are shared with digital or analog alternate functions. All GPIOs are high-current-capable and have speed selection to better manage internal noise, power consumption.
In general, it has the following features:

1.	Control GPIO input/output direction by using direction register
2.	Internal pull-up/pull-down resistor by using pull-up/pull-down resistor control register
3.	Select suitable output driving current capability
