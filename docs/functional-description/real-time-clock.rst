Real time clock(RTC)
======================

The real-time clock (RTC) is an independent BCD timer/counter. Dedicated registers contain the second, minute, hour (in 12/24 hour), week day, date, month, year, in BCD (binary- coded decimal) format. Correction for 28, 29 (leap year), 30, and 31 day of the month are performed automatically. The RTC provides a programmable alarm and programmable periodic interrupts with wakeup from Stop and Standby modes. The sub-seconds value is also available in binary format.

It is clocked by a 32.768 kHz external crystal, resonator or oscillator, the internal low-power RC oscillator or the high-speed external clock divided by 128. The internal low-speed RC has a typical frequency of 32 kHz. The RTC can be calibrated using an external 512 Hz output to compensate for any natural quartz deviation.

The systemâ€™s features:

1.	Support 32bit Independent power supply real time counter.
2.	Support alarm interrupt and second interrupt.
